# Space Flight Now News Tracker

A chrome extension for tracking news from Space Flight Now. I wrote it to save my time when under stress - I noticed I was clicking my Space Flight Now link in the browser's bookmarks bar several times a minute to check for news. This extension notifies you every 60 minutes if there's something new to know about :)
